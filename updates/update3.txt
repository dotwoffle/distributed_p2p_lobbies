This week, we have started implementing our state sharing algorithm. At this point, clients have a way to store their
relevant game states, and are able to call raiseEvent() to broadcast their states to the rest of the lobby. Clients
then receive those states and will be able to update themselves using the new states. We plan to finalize the algorithm
next week and begin writing tests. This is in line with our milestones.
